Here are some of my project and snippets of code.

web.demo > an old java demo app I've made but shows essentially what Spring mechanisms I know and use in general
nek_front > React.js app in progress that usualy communicates with another java web service and an Oracle DB in a docker container that in the end shows some locations and scoring of realestate (/nek_front/work_in_progress.png)
Powershell snippet > It's a powershell-based app with Windows Forms GUI intended to be used for updating project modules using maven (mvn clean install) etc.
PLSQL > I've made code that shows how well filled columns are in an Oracle DB table, so that it would show how much more information can one gather by creating a join query with that table
SQL_snippets > Just an example for analyzing tables
Docker_snippets > simple Dockerfile and yaml code I've been using lately
More_java_code > some parts of my code from a private project regarding realestate




When I'm writing the code I usually stick to: make it work then format it to the standard of the project while simultaneously watching sonarLint highlighted problems and warnings in the code.
We have code reviews for every merge request, so I'm used to going by the good practices of clean code, even though I'm sometimes careless when writing the code for my own private projects.
I have a problem with sharing the newer java "realestate" project I'm woriking on as I have plans to monetize the app as service for realestate agencies.

All in all, I handle Spring framework on a functional level, often forgetting what and how some of the annotations work but easily remembering myself with the documentation or code overview when needed.
In the projects that I'm currently working on in the firm, Spring is lightly used as most of the code is legacy (the project being 10+ years old) so most of the configurations are still written in xml.
When it comes to tools and languages, I'm am sort of an agnostic, almost not caring what is used for the development, but rather enjoying making it work and seeng the end result.


Lately, I've been using React.js, but Angular and Vue seem to be very similar. They all have this notion of creating your own components that are made of HTML which are then dynamically changed by the result of a function. 
Also using hooks which are lambda functions that are executed when needed in certain steps of generating the view, like trigers. 
I would be very happy to learn Vue for example, which I haven't used before, especially since it gained popularity in the past few years.
